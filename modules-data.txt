MODULES
Modules
- Way to bundle Angular Blocks together
- Angular doesnt scan the files, so you have to do it manually
- An angular must have at least one module

ANALIZING APP MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AppModule
- declarations
	- list of custom elements for the app, to use in the app
- imports
	- allow to use other modules into the app
	- also allows to use little parts as a whole
		- instead of adding them as declarations for each one
- providers
	- services we wanna provide
	- any service to inject, need to be provided
- booostrap
	- for starting the app
	- which component will the root for index.html
	- usually just one
- entryComponents
	- for components created in code



AppRoutingModule
- Custom module for the route configuration
- the little custom module, allow to make them cohesive
- the custom module must be exported to be used

Modules
- every module works on its own, dont communicate with each other
- declarations only work on the module where is added, not on others
- so we need to export modules, to use them on others modules


SHARED MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- module to put shared components that are used across diferent modules


CORE MODULE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - provide all services in a separate module
 - this will be injected into the app module


LAZY LOADING
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- concept of OPTIMIZATION
- in the case that each module is assigned to a specific URL route 
  - each one will have their own componentes, services, providers
- when we load the app form the server, the whole app is retrieved to the client
- lazy loading: when requiring an URL from the server only the module Path code
  is retrieved
    - code of other modules, will be downloaded only when those URLs are required
	  until these are not requires, these will not be downloaded

- to use lazy loading, module with routes are required
