MODULES
Modules
- Way to bundle Angular Blocks together
- Angular doesnt scan the files, so you have to do it manually
- An angular must have at least one module

ANALIZING APP MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AppModule
- declarations
	- list of custom elements for the app, to use in the app
- imports
	- allow to use other modules into the app
	- also allows to use little parts as a whole
		- instead of adding them as declarations for each one
- providers
	- services we wanna provide
	- any service to inject, need to be provided
- booostrap
	- for starting the app
	- which component will the root for index.html
	- usually just one
- entryComponents
	- for components created in code



AppRoutingModule
- Custom module for the route configuration
- the little custom module, allow to make them cohesive
- the custom module must be exported to be used

Modules
- every module works on its own, dont communicate with each other
- declarations only work on the module where is added, not on others
- so we need to export modules, to use them on others modules


SHARED MODULES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- module to put shared components that are used across diferent modules
